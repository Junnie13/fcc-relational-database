# Relational Database

This repository contains the source code and materials for the Relational Database course offered by FreeCodeCamp.org. The course focuses on using real developer tools and software, including VS Code, PostgreSQL, and the Linux/Unix command line, to complete interactive tutorials and build projects.

## Course Description

In this course, you will:

1. **Learn Basic Bash Commands**: Start with basic Bash commands and learn how to navigate and manipulate a file system using the terminal. You will progress from simple commands to scripting in Bash and advanced usage.

2. **Create and Use a Relational Database with PostgreSQL**: Dive into the world of relational databases by learning how to create and use a database management system using PostgreSQL. You will also learn SQL, the language used for interacting with relational databases.

3. **Version Control with Git**: Understand Git, the version control system, which is an essential tool for every developer. Learn how to track changes in your projects, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of your code using Git.
